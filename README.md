# LiT5 (List-in-T5) Reranking

## üìü Instructions

We provide the scripts and data necessary to reproduce reranking results for [LiT5-Distill](LiT5-Distill.sh) and [LiT5-Score](LiT5-Score.sh) on DL19 and DL20 for BM25 and SPLADE++ ED first-stage retrieval. Note you may need to change the batchsize depending on your VRAM. We have observed that results may change slightly when the batchsize is changed. 

## Models
